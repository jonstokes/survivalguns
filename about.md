# About me
I’m a recovering tech journalist and a “Bernie Bro,” so I'm not your typical gun guy. But I’ve been a passionate supporter of the Second Amendment since I was a child—I grew up hunting and was a Life Scout, and more recently I’ve been immersed in the outdoors/shooting/survival space since early 2013. I have written about guns and 2A issues for mainstream publications like Wired, TechCrunch, and Vox, as well as for outdoors-oriented sites like AllOutdoor.com. (I’m also one of the founders of Ars Technica, though I never wrote about guns for that site.)

I don’t claim to know everything about guns or survival, but I know as much about gun people and preppers as anyone you’re likely to meet. As a lifelong student of geek cultures, my specialty is diving into niche communities and figuring out what sorts of arguments they’re having, what the stakes are, and what kinds of conclusions they’re drawing. So this site is my constantly evolving distillation of the survivalist/prepper nerd zeitgeist around doomsday firearms.
