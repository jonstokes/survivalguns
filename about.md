# About Me
I’m a recovering tech journalist and a “Bernie Bro,” so I'm not your typical gun guy. But I’ve been a passionate supporter of the Second Amendment since I was a child—I grew up hunting and was a Life Scout, and more recently I’ve been immersed in the outdoors/shooting/survival space since early 2013.

I have written about guns and 2A issues for mainstream publications like [Wired](http://www.wired.com/), [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/), and [Vox](http://www.vox.com/), as well as for outdoors-oriented sites like [AllOutdoor.com](http://www.alloutdoor.com/). (I’m also one of the founders of [Ars Technica](http://www.arstechnica.com/), though I never wrote about guns for that site.)

I don’t claim to know everything about guns or survival, but I know as much about gun people and preppers as anyone you’re likely to meet. As a lifelong student of geek cultures, my specialty is diving into niche communities and figuring out what sorts of arguments they’re having, what the stakes are, and what kinds of conclusions they’re drawing. So this site is my constantly evolving distillation of the survivalist/prepper nerd zeitgeist around doomsday firearms.

Here's a not-so-complete list of links to my writing on gun-related topics.

- [My personal site](http://jonstokes.com/), where I don't really write about guns, or much of anything, recently.
- [Why millions of Americans — including me — own the AR-15](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11975850/ar-15-owner-orlando). I wrote this for Vox after Orlando. (Actually, I wrote it for Medium, but Vox picked it up.)
- My own journey with the AR-15 began with this long Wired piece I wrote in the wake of Newtown: [The AR-15 Is More Than a Gun. It's a Gadget.](https://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/) This is still the longest and most substantial thing I've written on the AR platform — I attended the SHOT Show in Vegas, interviewed gunmakers and enthusiasts, and generally did old-fashioned reporting. This piece covers the history, development, and present culture around the black rifle.
- More recently, I've written on the assault weapons ban in the context of a discussion of smart guns for Tech Crunch: [Why the NRA hates smart guns](http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/30/why-the-nra-hates-smart-guns/).
- The best thing I've done on the topic of smart guns was my first piece for TechCrunch, [Why Obama’s Smart Gun Push Will Misfire](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/05/why-obamas-smart-gun-push-will-misfire/). This is a pretty extensive takedown of the entire smart gun idea.
- [Confessions of a Progressive Gun Nut](https://medium.com/@jonst0kes/confessions-of-a-progressive-gun-nut-ae0e6a8f6146#.htsnyppf4). An essay I did on Medium about why I own guns.
- [Why I am Not a Doomsday Prepper](http://www.alloutdoor.com/2015/03/11/doomsday-prepper/). I believe in preparedness, but I'm not actually a real doomsday prepper. Here's why.
