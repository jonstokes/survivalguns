        <h2 id="whats-here">What’s here</h2>
<p>This site isn’t a list of my personal gun recommendations. Rather, it aims to distill the general consensus that I’ve uncovered through extensive reading of bulletin boards and blogs, and in the many face-to-face conversations I’ve had with people who have devoted some or all of their lives to thinking about and training for survival and use-of-force scenarios.</p>

<p>I’ll give my personal opinion from time to time, but ultimately this site aims to capture a broader consensus. It’s also a work in progress, so I’ll be updating it regularly with tweaks, fixes, and new resources. (Give me your email and I’ll alert you periodically when it updates, or you can subscribe via RSS.)</p>

<p>If you do even a little bit of research on the guns and topics I cover here, then you’ll quickly figure out that almost every recommendation I make is controversial to some degree or another. In fact, because we’re not currently in a total “lights out” situation, a big part of the practical day-to-day of what it means to be a “prepper” or “survivalist” is going online and arguing with others about “what is the best XYZ for SHTF.” But that’s ok, because the whole point of this site is to save you the trouble of having to go down every last survivalist rabbit hole; I’ve already done that for you.</p>

<p>It’s also the case that for every firearm in existence, there are at least a hundred know-it-all gun weenies in various forums who live to heap scorn on that specific gun and anyone who recommends it; such is the nature of the neck-bearded beast. One of the skills you acquire in reading tons of gun websites and forums is learning to spot these goobers and ignore them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if the S ever does hit the F, all of the options listed on this site should serve you quite well, even if the consensus doesn’t actually capture the absolute very best gun at any given moment. If someone tells you that any of these choices are terrible, then that person is outside the mainstream. That doesn’t mean they’re wrong—when the balloon goes up it may turn out that they’re the only one who’s actually right about all this!—but it does mean the burden of proof is on them.</p>

<p>I should also note that in many cases there’s a newer, fancier gun that’s no doubt better in some important ways than a particular recommendation I’ve made. That’s fine. Such is the nature of technology. If it does turn out that this newer gun really is better, then at some point in the future a new consensus will form around it and the older recommendation will get bumped in favor of it. I’ll then update the site, and if you’re following along then you’ll know about the new hotness.</p>
