        <h2 id="who-this-site-is-for">Who this site is for</h2>
<p>More and more of my non-gun-owning friends have begun freaking out about the state of the world for a variety of reasons — e.g. global warming, the Russians, and Donald Trump, to name a few big ones. These folks are discretely asking me (and people like me) for gun recommendations, so this site is my gift to them. Now, I can just send them a link, instead of a long email that still doesn’t quite cover it all.</p>

<p>So if you’re new to guns and you’re freaked out enough that you’re seriously considering <a href="https://medium.com/@jonst0kes/confessions-of-a-progressive-gun-nut-ae0e6a8f6146#.c0m0mrf7g">firearms as an insurance policy</a>, but you have no idea where to begin, then this site will give you what you need.</p>

<h2 id="whats-here">What’s here</h2>
<p>This site isn’t a list of my personal gun recommendations. Rather, it aims to distill the general consensus that I’ve uncovered through extensive reading of bulletin boards and blogs, and in the many face-to-face conversations I’ve had with people who have devoted some or all of their lives to thinking about and training for survival and use-of-force scenarios. <a href="/survivalguns/whats-here.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I’m a recovering tech journalist and a “Bernie Bro,” so I’m not your typical gun guy. But I’ve been a passionate supporter of the Second Amendment since I was a child—I grew up hunting and was a Life Scout, and more recently I’ve been immersed in the outdoors/shooting/survival space since early 2013. I have written about guns and 2A issues for mainstream publications like Wired, TechCrunch, and Vox, as well as for outdoors-oriented sites like AllOutdoor.com. (I’m also one of the founders of Ars Technica, though I never wrote about guns for that site.)   <a href="/survivalguns/about.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<h2 id="the-guns">The Guns</h2>
<p>If the SHTF, the primary, number one thing you’re going to want is <em>options</em>. In a disaster, the (situation is fluid)<a href="http://www.alloutdoor.com/2014/07/09/one-gun-three-guns-tshtf-bad-idea/"></a>, and you’re constantly moving and reacting to novel scenarios that you couldn’t possibly have foreseen.</p>

<p>Given that it’s impossible to think everything through and prepare for every eventuality, the best thing you can do, then, is to give yourself a diverse, flexible set of tools that you can adapt to fit whatever scenario you encounter out there.</p>

<p>The list that you’ll see below is designed to maximize your options in the any scenario that involves violence, whether it be taking wild game or defense of person and property; it’s short but potent, because you don’t need tons of guns—you just need the right ones.</p>

<p>This list is also fairly standard; you’ll find lists very much like this—in many cases identical to it—on survivalist sites across the internet. The calibers that it represents—.22LR, 12 gauge, 7.62x39 (or .223), .9mm, and .308, are the “Big 5” calibers that most preppers stockpile. Sure, some folks make substitutions, like .45 ACP or .357 Magnum instead of .9mm, but the consensus that this list embodies is fairly solid and widespread.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: For every long gun on this site, a sling is an essential part of the weapon system, just like a properly fitted holster is essential for every pistol. I don’t mention slings or holsters separately in any of these entries, because you should just assume they’re mandatory.</p>

<h3 id="the-foundation">The Foundation</h3>
<h4 id="rimfire-rifle">Rimfire Rifle</h4>
<p>Most preppers and survivalists consider a rimfire gun to be the foundation of any preparedness arsenal. Rimfire ammo doesn’t pack much of a punch, but it’s still deadly, even against man-sized targets given the right shot placement. What makes rimfire, specifically .22LR, the definitive prepper round is that it’s cheap, lightweight, and compact. A prepper can buy, store, and discretely transport many thousands of rounds of rimfire ammo for a fraction of the cost and effort of larger centerfire cartridges. <a href="/survivalguns/rimfire.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Top pick: <a href="/survivalguns/rimfire.html#top-pick">Ruger 10/22, stainless</a></li>
  <li>Alternate: <a href="/survivalguns/rimfire.html#alternate-pick">Ruger Mark IV, Stainless</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="12-gauge-pump-shotgun">12 Gauge Pump Shotgun</h4>
<p>For decades, the pump-action shotgun has been a staple of law enforcement and home defense arsenals because of its high capacity, ease of use, reliability, versatility, and devastating lethality. <a href="/survivalguns/shotgun.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Top pick: <a href="/survivalguns/shotgun.html#top-pick">Mossberg 500</a></li>
  <li>Alternate: <a href="/survivalguns/shotgun.html#alternate-pick">Remington 870</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-first-level">The First Level</h3>
<h4 id="centerfire-semi-automatic-rifle">Centerfire Semi-Automatic Rifle</h4>
<p>Now that you’ve laid the foundation of your disaster arsenal with .22LR and 12 gauge options, you’re ready to take step and get truly serious. Some flavor of centerfire semi-auto (or full-auto) rifle is the standard—and in some cases only—military issued weapon for armed groups the world over, from roving gangs of African child soldiers to elite US special forces units. <a href="/survivalguns/centerfire-rifle.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Top pick: <a href="/survivalguns/centerfire-rifle.html#top-pick">AK-47</a></li>
  <li>Alternate: <a href="/survivalguns/centerfire-rifle.html#alternate-pick">AR-15</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="defensive-handgun">Defensive Handgun</h4>
<p>There are many conceivable SHTF scenarios in which you don’t want anyone to know that you’re armed. Maybe you’re traveling with a group and don’t want to be a target for theft, or maybe you’ve let some nice-seeming folks into your apartment (hey, they have a cute kid with them!) but you’re not quite sure if you can trust them, yet. My point is this: there are very few scenarios in which walking around with a rifle or shotgun openly slung across your back will be ok, so for everything else there’s the concealable handgun. <a href="/survivalguns/handgun.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Top pick: <a href="/survivalguns/handgun.html#top-pick">Glock 19</a></li>
  <li>Alternate: <a href="/survivalguns/handgun.html#alternate-pick">Glock 17</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-next-level">The Next Level</h3>
<h4 id="long-range-rifle">Long-range Rifle</h4>
<p>With the four guns you’ve already picked up, you’re now prepared for the worst that the apocalypse can throw at you. At this point, then, you’re now in the realm of looking for an extra edge. <a href="/survivalguns/long-range-rifle.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Top pick: <a href="/survivalguns/long-range-rifle.html#top-pick">Remington 700 in .308</a></li>
  <li>Alternate: <a href="/survivalguns/long-range-rifle.html#alternate-pick">AR-10</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="air-gun">Air Gun</h4>
<p>Not everyone who’s thinking about tooling up for the apocalypse is ready to make the leap into firearms. Some families just aren’t ever going to be cool with having a gun in the house, while others live in areas where guns are so restricted that they’re worried about getting grief from neighbors or authorities if it gets out that they’re armed. And then there are folks who’ve served their time and payed their debt to society in a federal prison, but are legally barred from exercising their Second Amendment rights. <a href="/survivalguns/airgun.html">More &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Top pick: <a href="/survivalguns/airgun.html#top-pick">.22 gas piston rifle</a></li>
  <li>Alternate: <a href="/survivalguns/airgun.html#alternate-pick">.357 caliber rifle</a></li>
