<p>Now that you’ve laid the foundation of your disaster arsenal with .22LR and 12 gauge options, you’re ready to take step and get truly serious. Some flavor of centerfire semi-auto (or full-auto) rifle is the standard—and in some cases only—military issued weapon for armed groups the world over, from roving gangs of African child soldiers to elite US special forces units.</p>

<p>In a full-blown (WROL)<a href="http://www.abbreviations.com/term/548892"></a> scenario, where we’re in a (Hobbesian state of nature)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature"></a> and you really need serious firepower for use on everything from coyote-sized varmints to leather-wearing, motorcycle-riding marauders, a semi-automatic centerfire rifle will be your go-to gun.</p>

<p>Sure, you can skip the centerfire rifle and plan to rely on your wits, or your crossbow, or your big knife, but if you chose this path then your most likely legacy in a post-(TEOTWAWKI)<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TEOTWAWKI"></a> world is that you’ll leave behind a nice supply cache for the better armed among us.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer-the-ar-vs-the-ak">Disclaimer: the AR vs. the AK</h2>
<p>Before I get into the guns themselves, a massive disclaimer is in order. “AR vs AK for SHTF” is probably the number one debate in the prepping/survival community. Nothing gets preppers going more than this one issue; people get <em>really</em> riled up over it. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>This page isn’t the place to dive deeply into this debate—you can spend years of your life pondering this question, and even the world’s foremost experts disagree on its answer. I’m just going to give a few quick points for why I’ve put the AK-47 in the top slot, despite the fact that in my own preps I personally have landed on the AR-15 side of the fence.</p>

<p>The two points I’ll make are these: 1) this site isn’t about my personal picks, but about consensus, and 2) my target audience is non-gun people who want a modest firearm stash “just in case” but don’t plan to geek out on guns, which means that I’m looking to capture the consensus around the question of the best SHTF rifle for this specific type of user.</p>

<p>To the first point about consensus, I’m not just talking about the online consensus, though there is that. I’ve been having in-person conversations about this very issue with shooters of all stripes, from 3Gun competitors to current and former military to folks who make ARs for a living, ever since I started my annual trip to SHOT Show in 2013. I can summarize the sense of this “AR vs AK” issue that I’ve gotten from talking to these guys as follows:</p>

<p>The AR-15 is more ergonomic, flexible, lightweight (ammo included), and accurate than an AK, and if you buy a quality AR it’s just as reliable as an AK. For these reasons and more, millions of us who actively use our rifles for hunting, varmint control, competition, self-defense, etc., prefer the battle-tested AR-15 platform. We’ve invested heavily in the AR-15, in terms of parts, training, ammo, and accessories, and if the SHTF the AR is the rifle that we’ll grab because it’s what we know and love and are prepared to use and maintain for a very long time.</p>

<p>But if you’re not a gun person, and you just want a rifle that bury in your backyard along with a stockpile of cheap ammo, a rifle that will still shoot straight after years of abuse and total neglect, then the AK-47 is probably your gun.</p>

<p>So if you pick the AR-15, you should be prepared to learn as much as you can about the gun. Apart from basic operation and troubleshooting, you’ll want to learn to do your own maintenance, upgrades, and parts replacements. Luckily for all of us, the modern AR is an amateur tinkerer’s dream, and it’s super easy to do your own work on with minimal tools. Still, you have to do it, and you have to know how to do it.</p>

<p>Your reward for picking the AR-15 is that it maximizes your options. You can change calibers, barrel lengths, buttstocks, triggers—anything on the gun can be altered to suit any situation you face. Whether you need a short-barrel gun for urban/indoor assault, or a long-range shooter for hunting and sniping, the same AR can be easily configured either way.</p>

<p>If you are not willing to put in the time, effort, and money to purchase a high-quality AR and then immerse yourself in the AR-15 platform and ecosystem, and you just want a centerfire assault rifle that will go bang whenever you pull the trigger, then grab an AK and be done with it. Your AK won’t be nearly as flexible as your buddy’s AR—even getting an optic mounted on it will be a pain—but it’s cheap to acquire and train with, easy to learn, and as close to zero maintenance as a semi-auto rifle gets.</p>

<p>Because the AK is the best pick for the beginning prepper who isn’t a “gun guy” and who wants a rifle on-hand “just in case,” and because it’s also the choice of many advanced preppers who also love the AR but prefer the AK for a total collapse scenario, I’ve selected it as the Top Pick.</p>

<h2 id="top-pick-ak-47">Top Pick: AK-47</h2>

<p>Whenever you find yourself on some foreign battlefield, facing a ragtag army of poorly equipped irregulars with few possessions beyond the clothes on their back, a rifle, and a ration of ammo, the odds are good that their rifle will be some flavor of AK-47.</p>

<p>The AK is cheap, easy to shoot, and its reputation for reliability and toughness is unmatched. This gun can even operate with many of its parts missing, and in some cases suitable replacement parts can be hacked together in the field from random bits and baubles. You can lube this weapon with everything from WD-40 to bacon grease, or, you can just not lube it at all and run it chock full of sand and grime—either way, it’ll still probably shoot.</p>

<p>The AK’s .30-caliber round is big enough to do plenty of damage to critters that are man-sized and larger, and it’s cheap enough to stockpile in large volumes. Its reputation for accuracy isn’t the best, but you don’t buy the AK as a sniper weapon.</p>

<p>Another advantage the AK has is its foldable stock; with the stock folded sideways the overall length of the gun can be drastically shortened, making it much more maneuverable when used indoors.</p>

<p>The downside to the AK (relative to the AR) is weight. The AK’s .30-caliber ammo weighs about 30% more than the AR’s, and that extra poundage adds up significantly if you’re on foot. Weight matters a great deal in an infantry rifle, regardless of how good a shape you’re in, so this is a very real disadvantage for the AK.</p>

<p>There are a number of solid AK models to chose from, and in fact “which AK for SHTF?” is a super common question on various survival sites.</p>

<p>For an AK variant in the $600-$700 range, I’m going to suggest the Romanian WASR 10. Like every gun, it has its detractors, but it’s a top seller year after year, and you almost never read a complaint about reliability.</p>

<p>If you want to go upmarket, you can get into some really nice AKs and AK variants from companies like (Arsenal)<a href="http://www.arsenalinc.com/usa/"></a> and IWI (I like the (Galil ACE)<a href="http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/08/19/galil-ace-review/"></a>) starting at around $1,800 and going up to over $3,000. But if you’re going to spend that much scratch, I’m going to recommend an AR from a top-tier maker like Lewis Machine &amp; Tool (LMT), Daniel Defense, LWRC, or the like. The point of the AK, at least for the purposes of this site, is to get you into an ultra-reliable, no-hassle, no-frills rifle for under a $1,000. Once you start getting fancy, you might as well look at the AR.</p>

<p><em>Key Upgrade</em>: If you’re into upgrades in the traditional sense of “stuff I add to the gun to make it better,” you should buy an AR-15. Otherwise, the primary way to upgrade an AK is to spend more money on a fancier AK or AK variant.</p>

<p>I’ve written extensively on the reasons why (millions of Americans chose the AR-15)<a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11975850/ar-15-owner-orlando"></a> as their go-to rifle. I’ve also written about the (history and development)<a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/"></a> of this amazing weapon platform. So I don’t want to recap that, here. What I will say is that if you’re willing to put in the money and the time with a rifle, then you can’t go wrong with a quality AR-15.</p>

<p>My pick for a no-compromises AR-15 that has all the best features of the AR platform and toughness and reliability on par with an AK, is the (LMT CQB MRP Defender Model 16)<a href="http://www.lmtstore.com/complete-weapon-systems-firearms-guns/complete-gas-weapons/cqb-mrp-defender-model-16.html"></a>. I have two of these in my safe, one with a quad rail and a piston operating system, and the other with “slick sides” and a direct gas impingement (DI) operating system. (The (piston vs. DI)<a href="http://gundigest.com/reviews/rifles/ar-15-gas-impingement-vs-piston"></a> debate is a really deep rabbit hole. The consensus seems to be that a DI AR is lighter, simpler, and easier to find replacement parts for, so if the SHTF I’d grab my DI gun.)</p>

<p>Like all guns from LMT, the CQB16 is expensive, coming in at around $2,000 street. But you don’t really have to spend that much money to get a good AR. Indeed, I’ll be the first to admit that me owning and shooting an LMT is like driving an armored Humvee to Whole Foods to buy kale—it’s ridiculous overkill. But thankfully I can afford it, so I splurged.</p>

<p>For about $500 less than the LMT you can get into a Daniel Defense DDM4 variant—their (catalog is huge)<a href="https://danieldefense.com/firearms.html"></a>, so you’ll need to shop around to figure out where to land.</p>

<p>For half the price of the LMT you can pick up a (Colt LE6920)<a href="http://www.cabelas.com/product/COLT-LE-CENTERFIRE-RIFLE/1954783.uts"></a> that,  under most circumstances, is likely to serve you just as well a gun that’s twice as expensive. (For whatever reason Colt has its detractors, but they make a top-notch, battle-tested AR, so just ignore the hate.)</p>

<p>A little bit lower on the price/performance pole are brands like DPMS, Del-ton, or the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P 15 line. Or, if you want to step slightly outside the traditional AR world and look at AR-style guns that have some proprietary parts, AR variants from and Ruger and Sig Sauer are good choices.</p>

<p>We’re living in the golden age of the AR-15, so there are many great guns out there at different price points, but you’ll need to do some homework to figure out exactly what you need. In fact, picking an AR-15, especially a good first AR-15, is the subject of thousands of articles and books, so you’re going to have to do your homework. Again, if you’re not prepared to immerse yourself in the AR world, at least enough to make an informed purchase decision, then you might consider just picking up a Romanian WASR 10 and calling it a day.</p>

<p><em>Key Upgrade</em>: Magnified Optic. One of the main reasons to pick the AR-15 is the ease with which the weapon can be upgraded and accessorized, and the number one upgrade for any AR is an optic with 3X or 4X magnification. Vortex and Burris make quality magnified AR optics at a good price, or, if you really want to drop some cash you can pick up the military-issued Trijicon ACOG.</p>

<p>Magnification is great to have, but it comes at the cost of a bit of weight. If weight is an issue for you, I recommend a reflex sight or a red dot sight (RDS) from Aimpoint. I have an Aimpoint T2 on my main AR, and the battery life and durability of these optics is legendary.</p>
