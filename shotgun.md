# 12 Gauge Pump Shotgun
For decades, the pump-action shotgun has been a staple of law enforcement and home defense arsenals because of its high capacity, ease of use, reliability, versatility, and devastating lethality.

The primary advantage of a shotgun in a grid-down situation is its extreme versatility—a 12-gauge shotgun gives you more options than perhaps any other gun on this list. Depending on the round you put in it, a shotgun can be used for small game like squirrels and rabbits, waterfowl and other birds, deer, humans, wild boar, and even bears. No other gun offers this range of uses.

The tradeoff is weight—shotgun shells are the largest and heaviest ammo on this list. It’s difficult to conceal a large stash of shotgun shells in a smallish apartment, and carrying a high round count with you in a bug-out situation is typically out of the question.

Despite the weight disadvantage, many preppers will rank a shotgun above a rimfire in importance, and will insist that it be the foundation of any prepper’s arsenal. I won’t argue this point because it’s totally valid, and indeed I actually think you should have both, if you can.

## Top Pick: Mossberg 500

The Mossberg 500 is a pump shotgun with a decades-long track record in everything from law enforcement to hunting. It’s simple to operate and maintain, and replacement parts are widely available. Replacement barrels of varying lengths — shorter is better for home defense, and longer is better for hunting — are cheap and easy to obtain and install.

A Mossberg 500, when combined an array of ammo types and a pair of barrels (18.5” for indoor maneuverability an self-defense, and 24” for outdoors and hunting), is just about as close to the ideal, one-gun-for-everything SHTF load-out as it’s possible to get.

*Key Upgrade*: Extra barrels.

## Alternate Pick: Remington 870

Everything I said about the Mossberg 500 is also true of the Remington 870. In fact, the “Mossberg 500 vs Remington 870” debate is the “Ford vs. Chevy” debate of prepping world. Both of these are great guns, and the only reason I gave the Mossberg the top slot is that it’s what I happen to shoot. If you can get your hands on an 870, I’m sure you’ll be just as happy as I am with my Mossberg.

*Key Upgrade*: Weapon-mounted light.
