# Rimfire Rifle
Most preppers and survivalists consider a rimfire gun to be the foundation of any preparedness arsenal. Rimfire ammo doesn’t pack much of a punch, but it’s still deadly, even against man-sized targets given the right shot placement. What makes rimfire, specifically .22LR, the definitive prepper round is that it’s cheap, lightweight, and compact. A prepper can buy, store, and discretely transport many thousands of rounds of rimfire ammo for a fraction of the cost and effort of larger centerfire cartridges.

## Top Pick: Ruger 10/22

The Ruger 10/22 is popular with preppers because it’s a .22LR gun that’s relatively inexpensive and widely available. This means that it’s cheap to stock up on replacement parts and magazines for it. It’s also easy to use, accurate, and reliable.

I’d pick the stainless model for ease of cleaning and long-term maintenance. In general, stainless guns cost a bit more than blued guns, but they’re preferable because the finish is easier to maintain. Light discipline is a problem for stainless, though, so if this is a concern for you then you may opt to purchase a gun with a coating, like Cerakote or a PVD flavor.

*Key Upgrade*: Magnified Optic. The main application of this gun will be hunting, so if at all possible you’ll want to mount a magnified optic on it. This will increase your accuracy with the weapon at typical hunting ranges, which has all sorts of beneficial effects like ammo conservation and noise discipline.

## Alternate Pick: Ruger Mark IV

Many folks who are considering a long-term bug-out scenario will want opt for a rimfire pistol instead of a rifle. A pistol is more compact and concealable than a rifle, which increases your options. The tradeoff is that it’s much harder to get shots on target with a pistol, especially at any range out beyond about twenty feet.

So if you opt for a rimfire pistol, then you should do two things: 1) put a reflex or red dot sight on it, and 2) train, train, train.

I’d selected the Ruger Mark IV for the same reasons I selected the Ruger 10/22— because it’s extremely popular, accurate, and reliable. The newer Mark IV model is also considerably easier to disassemble and maintain than its predecessors.

There are a number of good alternatives to the Mark IV, and I’ll put those in a future version.

*Key Upgrade*: Red dot sight or reflex sight. It’s really hard to hit things with a pistol, even when you’re taking your time and aiming carefully. For hunting applications an RDS or Reflex will give you a massive accuracy advantage with this gun.

For self-defense scenarios, the benefits of anything but iron sights are highly debatable, but .22LR isn’t a self-defense round (though it can be pressed into service as such).
