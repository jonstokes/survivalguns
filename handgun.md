# Defensive Handgun
There are many conceivable SHTF scenarios in which you don’t want anyone to know that you’re armed. Maybe you’re traveling with a group and don’t want to be a target for theft, or maybe you’ve let some nice-seeming folks into your apartment (hey, they have a cute kid with them!) but you’re not quite sure if you can trust them, yet. My point is this: there are very few scenarios in which walking around with a rifle or shotgun openly slung across your back will be ok, so for everything else there’s the concealable handgun.

The handgun caliber wars that raged for decades in the pages of gun magazines and across gun forums have all but ceased, at least for now. The clear consensus of today’s self-defense geeks is that the modern 9mm NATO round is the best choice for self defense. There are many folks out there who still don’t consider this debate settled, but I do, and it’s my site, so 9mm it is.

Apart from caliber considerations, there’s one other point I should make about selecting a handgun: if you actually intend to hit what you’re aiming at, “fit” matters a great deal in the beginning. Everyone’s hand and body is different, making buying handguns sort of like buying shoes—some are just going to fit you a lot better than others, so it pays to try as many as possible and see what works.

My personal handgun is a case in point. You’ll notice that I’ve picked Glocks as the Top Pick and Alternate Pick. But I personally have a Sig Sauer P239 that I adore and that I’d probably carry in a SHTF situation (either that or my Sig P226). By every normal metric—weight, size, ammo capacity, user friendliness—the The Sig P239 is a worse choice than the Glock 19. But it’s totally reliable, and, most importantly, I can really shoot it well (even that first double-action trigger pull is spot on for me). The fact that I can naturally shoot this gun accurately without having to spend a ton of time and money at the range makes it my personal pick. If at some point I have a bunch of time to invest in handgun training, so that I can build proficiency with a weapon that doesn’t come naturally to me, I’ll probably ditch my Sig and get on the Glock bandwagon.

At any rate, my ultimate point is this: if you can try a bunch of handguns out, then you definitely should pick the one that fits you best. But if you can’t try anything out and just want to get a gun now and maybe train with it later, just buy a Glock with complete confidence that you have the premier SHTF handgun.

## Top Pick
Glock 19

The Glock name is synonymous with absolute, total reliability, and the 9mm Glock 19 is unquestionably the most popular choice for a SHTF sidearm. As a slightly more compact and concealable version of the Glock 17, the Glock 19 can use magazines from a wide range of other Glock models.

I’m not going to say much more about this, because of all the gun picks on this site, this is probably the most open-and-shut case. If you’re new to guns and you don’t know what you’re doing, just buy a Glock 19. The fact that it’s a striker fired handgun with no actual controls means it’s perfect for the beginning shooter. And hey, the [Navy Seals just selected it](https://loadoutroom.com/17950/naval-special-warfare-selects-the-glock-19/) as their new sidearm, so it’s the choice of many professionals, as well.

*Key Upgrade*: Night sights. You never know when you’re going to have to reach for your pistol, so you’ll want the ability to use this gun at night. Thus a set of tritium-powered night sights is the first upgrade you should look at in a SHTF Glock.

## Alternate Pick
Smith & Wesson M&P

If you try out a Glock or two (maybe the 17 instead of the 19, for those with larger hands), and Gaston’s plastic wonder pistol just doesn’t fit your hand, the Smith & Wesson M&P is your next stop. As a polymer-framed, striker-fired handgun like the Glock, the M&P has no safety or decocker to fuss with—you just rack a cartridge in the chamber, then pull the trigger when you’re ready to fire. It’s simple, lightweight, compact, and reliable.

The M&P is the choice of many police departments, and realistically the level of reliability and toughness is the same as that of the Glock. The Glock has an edge in terms of reputation and prepper mystique, but you can buy the M&P and carry it with absolute confidence.

*Key Upgrade*: Weapon light. Assuming you’ve already got the night sights I recommended above, go ahead and get a weapon-mounted light. There are some drawbacks to having a light mounted directly on your weapon in a firefight, but having that other hand free (because it’s not holding a flashlight) gives you options, and we like options.
