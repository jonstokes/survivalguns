# FAQ

#### What about bows and crossbows?
Yeah no. Crossbows are great for killing zombies on TV, but in a real SHTF scenario [not so much](http://www.alloutdoor.com/2013/12/03/crossbows-viable-shtf-option/). If you really don’t want to (or can’t) buy a firearm, an [airgun]({{ site.url }}/airgun.html) is better than a bow or crossbow in nearly every respect.

#### I live in New Jersey, and I don’t see any recommendations here that I can use.
I’m so, so sorry. In NJ, only the criminals have guns, so if you’re a criminal then good for you, I guess. But if you’re a law-abider who’s serious about prepping, you should probably move. Otherwise, I suppose you can buy a slingshot or something. Either way, good luck with that.

#### Why all this emphasis on guns? What about other skills and tools?
I’m not here to tell you how to survive The Apocalypse. In fact, you probably won’t, and neither will I. No, this site is for people who have already decided that firearms should play a role in a larger preparedness strategy, and are looking for information.

As for other types of survival gear, stay tuned.

#### Are you some kind of Glock/Ruger/Mossberg/Etc. fanboy?
No. I’m a Sig Sauer and LMT fanboy, but beyond those two I don’t have much in the way of gun brand allegiances.

#### Is this website sponsored?
Not currently, but I guess I’m open to offers.

#### I hate this site! Where can I find you on social media so that I can tell you you’re wrong about everything and will get people killed?
Please don’t. I’ll just block you.

#### How can I contact you with feedback, praise, TV show offers, pictures of my personal SHTF arsenal, insane questions, rambling manifestos, etc.?
At some point I’ll put up a dedicated contact page if this site gets any traffic. In the meantime, it's best to use the [github issue queue](https://github.com/jonstokes/survivalguns/issues) for this site's repo. And hey, I'm open to pull requests, too.
