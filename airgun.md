# Air Rifle
Not everyone who’s thinking about tooling up for the apocalypse is ready to make the leap into firearms. Some families just aren’t ever going to be cool with having a gun in the house, while others live in areas where guns are so restricted that they’re worried about getting grief from neighbors or authorities if it gets out that they’re armed. And then there are folks who’ve served their time and payed their debt to society in a federal prison, but are legally barred from exercising their Second Amendment rights.

Some of people described above have watched a certain post-apocalyptic zombie TV show, and they run out and buy a crossbow, or a bow of some type. This is a [terrible idea](http://www.alloutdoor.com/2013/12/03/crossbows-viable-shtf-option/). Despite what you see on TV and what some preppers like to fantasize about, crossbows and bows have way too many, er, drawbacks, to make them anything but a last-resort choice for survival.

Luckily for survival-minded folks who can’t or just won’t buy a gun, there’s a wonderful, totally legal, entirely unregulated firearm alternative: the air rifle.

The air rifle is the original survival rifle. A [Girandoni air rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_air_rifle) went with Lewis and Clark on their famous expedition, where its high rate of fire and formidable power awed the natives that the group encountered.  

A [gas piston air rifle](https://www.airgunsofarizona.com/blog/2013/04/a-few-words-about-gas-rams-gas-springs-and-nitro-piston.html) in a larger caliber like .22 has plenty of power to take birds and small game. You can even take larger game with such a rifle if you’re a precise enough shot. Indeed, a .22 airgun is as good a choice for survival as a .22LR rifle for about 80% of the scenarios you’re likely to encounter, and given that airguns are often very quiet, it may be better.

Air rifles also have a few advantages over regular firearms. First, these guns are entirely unregulated at the federal level, and many states also have no regulations on their purchase. In [states where airguns are regulated](http://pelletgunzone.com/air-gun-laws/), they’re typically regulated far less stringently than firearms. This means that in most places, you can just walk into a store and buy an air rifle without a background check or any other hassle. (Of course, as with everything else gun-related, if you live in New Jersey, don’t bother; airguns are considered “firearms,” there.)

A gas piston air rifle will never wear out. Unlike the spring in a spring-powered air rifle, a gas piston’s usable lifespan is theoretically infinite. Early Theoben piston guns are still in use today, and work perfectly well. And if you’re paranoid, a replacement piston doesn’t cost much, so you can buy a few and keep them on hand.

Air rifle ammo is dirt cheap—you can get 500 rounds of hunting pellets for about $15. At that rate, if you spend $100 on air rifle ammo the post-apocalyptic wasteland will probably run out of critters before you run out of ammo.

If, for whatever reason, you do run out of airgun ammo, you can make more with some melted lead and a mold. So if you’re set on having an infinite supply of air rifle ammo, you can pick up the basic materials to make as much as you want for very little money.

For all of these reasons and more, an air rifle is a far better choice for a SHTF arsenal than any type of bow, and it may even be a better choice than a .22LR rifle for many possible of long-term grid-down scenarios.

# Top Pick: Umarex Octane .22

I’m not an airgun geek by any means, so right now I really can’t speak to a consensus. Once I get to know the space a little better, I’ll be able to weigh in with more confidence.

That said, my top pick is this Umarex rifle because I picked one at Bass Pro and have been very pleased with it, especially for the price. Furthermore, the reviews that it gets are fantastic, and I’ve talked to a few other owners of either this or the similarly specced Umarex Fuel, and everyone is happy with it. From what I can tell, this seems to be a great choice.

Apart from this gas piston and stellar reviews, the Umarex Octane has two more things to recommend it. First, it has a suppressor on the end, so it’s relatively quiet. It’s not quite “movie silencer” quiet, but it’s better than the loud crack that most air rifles make.

Second, it comes with a scope. This is important, because air rifle scopes are their own thing. An air rifle’s recoil impulse is very different from that of a firearm, so if you put a regular rifle optic on an air rifle then you’ll absolutely wreck that optic. You have to buy a specialized optic for these types of guns.

The scope that comes with the Umarex isn’t anything like the Leopold glass I use on my AR, but it’s plenty good enough for the kind of plinking and small game hunting that I use it or.

## Alternate Pick: Benjamin Bulldog .357 Air Rifle
![Benjamin Bulldog .357]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bulldog-357.jpg)

This recommendation is the one place where I’m going to totally ditch the “consensus” idea and just recommend something totally exotic and a bit idiosyncratic. You’ll realize why in just a moment.

The Benjamin Bulldog is an eight-shot, pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air rifle that you can use on deer, boar, cape buffalo, and other large game. That’s right, this is a totally unregulated, 8-shot semi-auto rifle that you can kill a bear with. You can just order it online, and it’ll ship right to your door—no FFL, no background check, no red tape. (Again, hurry up and buy one before CA figures this out.)

The Bulldog has a ton of knockdown power with very little recoil. I shot one at SHOT Show 2016 and loved it. It’s also getting [great reviews on PyramidAir.com](http://www.pyramydair.com/product-all-reviews/m/Benjamin_Bulldog_357_Bullpup_Shrouded/3592). This gun actually at the top of my list of SHTF guns that I don’t have yet.

With the exception of the gas piston (a PCP gun like this runs on a chamber of air that you fill up with a pump), the Bulldog has all of the advantages that I listed above for air rifles. It’s unregulated, the ammo is cheap, and if you want an infinite ammo supply you can buy some molds and cast your own fairly easily from hot lead that you stockpile or scavenge. Assuming that the gun holds up—this is a relatively new product, so long-term reliability is unknown—it’s pretty close the the perfect survival rifle for a long-term grid down situation.

Because this rifle hasn’t been on the market enough to really prove itself, there’s no way this should be your only SHTF gun option. Or, if it is, go ahead and buy two of them.
